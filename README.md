# Attendance_via_face_Recognition

An attendance system which will mark attendance of the person or student by recognizing the face of the student.

In this first of all for the all non registered students, students will have to register by giving their name ,id ,sec  and also have to register by giving their face image which will be detected by their front camera of pc or laptop , then student will have to save the data by clicking on save button.

For the registered students, student will click on the button to mark the attendance and then front camera will be open automatically and it will recognize the face of the student and student name , roll no, sec will shown on it and finally student will be marked as present.

So, basically there are three steps in a face recognition system.
  * Face Detection
  * Train the data
  * Recognize the face
To read the documentation of the face detection algorithm you can refer [this](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html#face-detection)
